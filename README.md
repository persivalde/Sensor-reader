Code Explanation: Sensor Data Acquisition and Processing

This Arduino sketch reads and processes data from three analog sensors:

A gas sensor connected to analog pin A0

A temperature sensor connected to A1

A third generic analog sensor connected to A2


The goal of the code is to reliably capture, filter, and interpret analog readings while addressing common issues like electrical noise, unstable values, and missing sensor connections.

Key Features and Improvements

1. SensorData Structure:
A custom struct SensorData is defined to group all sensor readings in a clean and organized format. It holds:

gas (raw value)

tempC (converted Celsius temperature)

sensor3 (raw value)



2. Noise Reduction through Averaging:
Each analog pin is read multiple times (10 by default), and the average is used. This technique reduces random fluctuations (noise) in analog signals.


3. Valid Range Checking:
Each analog reading is validated to ensure it’s within the expected range of 0 to 1023. If the reading is invalid (e.g., sensor not connected), a special value (like -1 or -1000.0) is used to indicate this.


4. Temperature Conversion:
The raw analog value from the temperature sensor is converted to Celsius. This assumes the sensor is an LM35, which outputs 10mV per °C. The conversion uses the formula:

tempC = (raw / 1023.0) * 5.0 * 100.0


5. Connection Status Check:
The code assumes a value of 0 or near-zero indicates a disconnected or faulty sensor. Such readings are flagged with error values to inform the user via serial output.


6. Serial Output for Debugging:
The sensor readings (or errors) are printed to the Serial Monitor every second, making it easy to monitor real-time performance or troubleshoot issues.

How It Works

In setup(), the serial communication is initialized.

In each loop:

1. readSensors() reads and processes all sensors.


2. The values are printed to the Serial Monitor.


3. A 1-second delay is added between cycles to prevent flooding and ensure readable output.

Summary

This code provides a stable and fault-tolerant way to read analog sensors with the Arduino. It’s a solid starting point for projects involving gas detection, temperature monitoring, or general analog sensor input. The use of averaging, value validation, and unit conversion makes it robust for both testing and deployment.
